# Boid_Graph

Boid_Graph is a graphics program written in C that allows you to create visualizations using boids. Boids are simulated objects that exhibit flocking behavior, resembling a psychedelic brush as they move across the screen.

## Controls

The program provides several controls to customize and interact with the visualization. Here's a description of the available controls:

- **Quit**: Press the **X** button or close the application window to exit the program.

- **Mouse Wheel**: Scroll the mouse wheel up or down to zoom in or out of the visualization. The program maintains the position of the boids as you zoom.

- **Escape**: Press the **Escape** key to exit the program.

- **Space**: Press the **Space** key to reset the positions of the boids. Boids will be randomly placed within the visible area.

- **Up**: Press the **Up** arrow key to increase the number of boids displayed on the screen.

- **Down**: Press the **Down** arrow key to decrease the number of boids displayed on the screen.

- **Left**: Press the **Left** arrow key to decrease the random speed of the boids.

- **Right**: Press the **Right** arrow key to increase the random speed of the boids.

- **R**: Press the **R** key to clear the screen (keep pushed for the actual movement with refreshing).

- **N**: Press the **N** key to toggle a 'NOT' mode (all boids are black).

- **G**: Press the **G** key to toggle the grid mode. When enabled, the boids will snap to a grid.

- **M**: Press the **M** key to increase the attraction force of the mouse. The higher the value, the stronger the attraction.

- **L**: Press the **L** key to decrease the attraction force of the mouse.

- **C**: Press the **C** key to toggle the rendering of boids. When enabled, boids will be rendered as circles instead of the default shape.
